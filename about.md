### Engineering:Robotics, 3.6 GPA
Graduating in May 2021


#### Skills
* Rapid Mechatronic Prototyping
* Python 3

#### Passion
When I'm not exploring the backcountry on skis or backpacking my local mountains, you'll find me working to build the [+One project](/projects/plus_one) or fiddling around with my [XY Plotter](/projects/xy_plotter). I love working on multidisciplinary projects and finding new challenges to further my skillsets.
