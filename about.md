#### Passion
When I'm not exploring the backcountry on skis or backpacking my local mountains, you'll find me working to build the +One project, [sewing a  new  piece of gear](https://barlowr.github.io/project_pages/myog.html) or fiddling around with my [XY Plotter](https://barlowr.github.io/projects/software/xyplotter.html). I love working on multidisciplinary projects and finding new challenges to further my skills.
