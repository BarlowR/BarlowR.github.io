#### Passion
When I'm not exploring the backcountry on skis or pedaling my way around New England, you'll find me writing an autopilot system for the +One project or designing my next set of speakers. I love finding new challenges to further develop my hardware and software skills; I hope to never stop learning.


#### Skills
