## Concertina Bag
2024-01-24


## Design Notes

Somehow I've managed to accumulate 5 different paragliding wings. Unfortunately I only have one [concertina bag](https://flybubble.com/bags/concertina-packing-bags), so most of them are just stored loosely. I had a bit of free time and some spare fabric a while ago, so I decided to throw one together. 
I roughly decided dimensions of 14"x27"x3", with 3" radius curves on the largest faces. I used 1.1 ripstop for the long wing collection (name?) part.

## Fabrication Notes

Nothing much here, just sewing together some simple panels. 


## Use Notes

The zipper shouldn't go all the way around the bag. Otherwise the bag has worked great! It fits my Phi Beat Light perfectly, and it fits my Ozone Zero 2 with a bit of extra space. If I was to make it again, I'd add a half inch to the depth of the bag.
