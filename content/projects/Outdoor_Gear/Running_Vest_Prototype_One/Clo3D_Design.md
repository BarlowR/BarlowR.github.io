## Fumbling around in Clo3D
2023-03-14

A few years back I made a thread on a Make Your Own Gear (MYOG) forum asking for recommendations for CAD softwares to use for designing gear. Stephen Jones (owner of [Bag Buff](https://www.bagbuff.com/)) responded with a recommendation for CLO3D, and added that he would be making a Youtube video on using the software in the future. Stephen's videos have been an amazing resource to me in learning to make my own equipment, so hearing from him directly was fantastic. 

Fast forward a few months and his tutorial on CLO3D appeared on his channel (included below). At the time, I was about to begin my thru-hike of the PCT, and given the difficulty of carrying a sewing machine or a laptop with me I wasn't able to dive right in. After I finished that adventure, I didn't get back into making equipment until halfway through 2022.

One of my aspirations for moving into the cottage (my small studio apartment/converted garage) was to get back into making gear. I found a Zoje ZJ20U33, a knockoff of the very popular Singer 20U33 industrial machine, on Craigslist and bought a servo motor for it off of amazon. The setup looks haphazard but it works great. 

I've recently been toying around with the idea of fastpacking, and I was digging around the internet for inspiration a few weeks ago. Fastpacking is a style of wilderness travel that mixes trail running with ultralight backpacking; it's a challenge both from an athletic perspective and a gear design perspective. The individual must be in great aerobic shape, and their gear has to be super lightweight and have a close anatomical fit. The reward is accessibility of much farther destinations than traditional backpacking. Strong fast packers can run 30+ miles in a day while a backpacker might only hike 15. 

From digging around the internet for different fastpacking bags, I think the crux of the problem is the creation of well fitting straps. These packs generally use a trail running vest style design to keep a snug but comfortable fit. The challenge of a designing this type of strap brought me back to CLO3D and the Bag Buff CLO3D video. 

I downloaded the CLO 3D free trial and started mucking about, following Stephen's tutorial in conjunction with the [guides provided by CLO3D](https://support.clo3d.com/hc/en-us/categories/360002306994-Lessons). My first goal was to make a prototype trail running vest to see how far off I was from the style of strap I'd like to use on a fastpacking bag. Fortunately the construction of such a bag is pretty simple, and it provided a great entry into using CLO3D for design work. 

One of the most useful features I discovered was the customizable avatar. This 3D model in CLO can be sized with real life measurements of an individual, and then used in CLO's 3D simulation engine to size designs and to characterize regions of high strain or pressure points. I took some measurements of myself, made an avatar, and sized my design to fit the avatar as best I could. Here are some screenshots of the design before I moved on to [Fabrication](/content/projects/Outdoor_Gear/Running_Vest_Prototype_One/Fabrication)
