## Finding Beauty in Industrial Expanse
2023-03-14


I went on a run this past weekend from my little corner of Santa Clara out towards the San Jose airport. For a while I've had it in my mind to make it out there to watch airplanes take off and land as I putter along. The Cottage, my affectionate term for my small 1br studio (converted garage), isn't near any big landmarks, so my runs never really go anywhere; I just head out into the surrounding suburbs. When I feel like I've gone far enough in any given direction, I turn around. The airport is one of the few exceptions- it's one of the few things I could call a "landmark" just within running distance. 

The path to get there isn't picturesque by any means. It took me down the side of 5 lane highways, across two sets of railroad tracks, past countless blank warehouses, a Home Depot, and the Movement Santa Clara climbing gym. I ended up arriving at the airport to find a huge highway and two massive fences surrounding the runways, and I nearly turned around before discovering an opening in the outer fence and signs very quietly advertising a bike path.
