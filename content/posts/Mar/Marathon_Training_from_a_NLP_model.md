### Marathon Training from a NLP model
2023-03-28

With the recent unveilng of ChatGPT and GPT-4, I've been curious as to ways I can leverage the system in my own life. It's fun to ask the program to generate random thoughts and hallucinations, but I think the potential for use of the system is much greater and far beyond anything we can even predict now. 

I've been looking around for a good resource for a marathon training plan that is primarily based around low intensity aerobic work and also incorporates climbing and strength training. I decided to ask the model to build me this training plan with these exact specifications. Here's what it spat out:


>#### Phase 1: Base Building (4-6 weeks)
>
>The focus of this phase is to build a solid base of aerobic fitness. You will be doing a lot of low-intensity training in Zone 1 and Zone 2 to develop your aerobic system, as well as some strength training and climbing to build your overall fitness.
>
>-   Week 1-2: Run 4-5 times a week, with 2-3 runs in Zone 1 (130-145 bpm) and 2 runs in Zone 2 (145-155 bpm). Total mileage should be around 20-25 miles per week. In addition, do 2 strength training sessions per week focusing on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and lunges, and 1 climbing session per week.
>-   Week 3-4: Increase to 5-6 runs per week, with 3 runs in Zone 1 and 2 runs in Zone 2. Total mileage should be around 25-30 miles per week. In addition, do 2 strength training sessions per week and 1-2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 5-6: Increase to 6 runs per week, with 3-4 runs in Zone 1 and 2 runs in Zone 2. Total mileage should be around 30-35 miles per week. In addition, do 2-3 strength training sessions per week and 2 climbing sessions per week.
>
>#### Phase 2: Endurance Building (8-10 weeks)
>
>The focus of this phase is to build endurance and increase your long run distance. You will continue to do a lot of Zone 1 and Zone 2 work, but with longer runs and some higher intensity work in Zone 3, as well as continued strength training and climbing.
>
>-   Week 1-2: Run 5-6 times a week, with 2-3 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 1 run in Zone 3 (155-165 bpm). Total mileage should be around 30-35 miles per week. In addition, do 2 strength training sessions per week and 1-2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 3-4: Increase to 6 runs per week, with 3 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 1 run in Zone 3. Total mileage should be around 35-40 miles per week. In addition, do 2 strength training sessions per week and 1-2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 5-6: Increase to 6 runs per week, with 3-4 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 1-2 runs in Zone 3. Total mileage should be around 40-45 miles per week. In addition, do 2-3 strength training sessions per week and 2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 7-8: Increase to 6 runs per week, with 3-4 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 2 runs in Zone 3. Total mileage should be around 45-50 miles per week. In addition, do 2-3 strength training sessions per week and 2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 9-10: Increase to 6 runs per week, with 3-4 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 2 runs in Zone 3. Total mileage should be around 50-55 miles per week. In addition, do 2-3 strength training sessions per week and 2-3 climbing sessions per week.
>
>#### Phase 3: Taper and Peak (2-3 weeks)
>
>The focus of this phase is to reduce your training volume and intensity to allow your body to fully recover and be ready for race day.
>
>-   Week 1: Reduce your mileage and intensity by 20-30% compared to your highest mileage week in Phase 2. Do 1-2 runs in Zone 1, 1-2 runs in Zone 2, and 1 short run in Zone 3. In addition, do 2 strength training sessions per week and 1-2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 2: Reduce your mileage and intensity by 40-50% compared to your highest mileage week in Phase 2. Do 1-2 runs in Zone 1, 1 short run in Zone 2, and no runs in Zone 3. In addition, do 1-2 strength training sessions per week and 1-2 climbing sessions per week.
>-   Week 3 (race week): Reduce your training volume by 70-80% compared to your highest mileage week in Phase 2. Do 1-2 short runs in Zone 1, and no runs in Zone 2 or 3. In addition, do 1 strength training session and 1-2 climbing sessions early in the week, but no later than 3 days before race day.
>
>#### Strength Training:
>
>Incorporate strength training 2-3 times per week, focusing on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, lunges, pull-ups, and push-ups. Start with 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps per exercise, and gradually increase the weight and reps over time. Keep the weight relatively light to avoid getting too sore, and focus on good form and technique.
>
>#### Climbing:
>
>Incorporate climbing 1-3 times per week, depending on your schedule and ability. Focus on bouldering or sport climbing, and try to climb routes or problems that challenge you both physically and mentally. Climbing is a great way to develop upper body strength and core stability, as well as mental toughness and problem-solving skills.
>
>Remember to listen to your body and adjust the plan as needed. If you feel overly fatigued or sore, take an extra rest day or reduce your training volume for a week. And most importantly, have fun and enjoy the process!

From my small experience in reading training plans, this seems really as good as any. The math is a little wonky but it looks like a good outline. I'd call the "Base Period" it describes more of a transition period, but the whole thing seems to follow a progressive ~5 mile increase each week and incorporates Zone 3 work where it should be. The taper looks alright as well. 

For further detail, I asked it to describe one of the endurance training weeks:

>Here's an example of a weekly training plan that includes 3-4 runs in Zone 1, 2 runs in Zone 2, and 2 runs in Zone 3, as well as 2-3 strength training sessions and 2 climbing sessions per week. The total weekly mileage is around 45-50 miles:
>
**Monday**
>
>-   Morning: Strength Training (60 minutes): Focus on full-body exercises such as squats, deadlifts, pull-ups, push-ups, and rows, with 3 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise.
>-   Afternoon: Zone 1 Run (6 miles): Run at a comfortable pace to build aerobic base and endurance.
>
>**Tuesday**
>
>-   Morning: Climbing Session (60 minutes): Focus on technique, endurance, and strength.
>-   Afternoon: Zone 1 Run (4 miles): Run at a comfortable pace to build aerobic base and endurance.
>
>**Wednesday**
>
>-   Rest Day: Allow for recovery and prevent injury.
>
>**Thursday**
>
>-   Morning: Strength Training (60 minutes): Focus on lower body exercises such as lunges, step-ups, and single-leg deadlifts, with 3 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise.
>-   Afternoon: Zone 2 Run (8 miles): Run at a moderate pace to build aerobic capacity and endurance.
>
>**Friday**
>
>-   Morning: Climbing Session (60 minutes): Focus on bouldering and building strength.
>-   Afternoon: Zone 3 Run (6 miles): Run at a harder, more intense pace to improve lactate threshold and build speed.
>
>**Saturday**
>
>-   Morning: Zone 1 Run (6 miles): Run at a comfortable pace to build aerobic base and endurance.
>-   Afternoon: Climbing Session (60 minutes): Focus on technique, endurance, and strength.
>
>**Sunday**
>
>-   Morning: Zone 2 Run (10 miles): Run at a moderate pace to build aerobic capacity and endurance.
>-   Afternoon: Rest and recovery.

This is as good as anything I could make myself. I'm curious to see how following the advice from an NLP model would pan out in my own fitness, so I think I'm going to try following the plan week by week. We'll see how it goes!
