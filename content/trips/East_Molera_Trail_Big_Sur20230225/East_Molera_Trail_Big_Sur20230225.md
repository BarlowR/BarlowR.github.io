## East Molera Trail Big Sur
## 2023-02-25


Maggie came to visit the cottage for the week, and she managed to bring two weeks of rain along with her. This seems to be a common theme; last time she visited in December we were hit  with the first major rain cycle of the 2022-23 winter. Fortunately, we were granted a sunny Saturday before the rain rolled in. 

The Ventana Wilderness has been [closed recently due to the heavy rains ](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd1084015.pdf)
