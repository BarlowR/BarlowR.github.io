## Ralston Peak 2023-04-08

I had the day off on Friday, so I drove out to Tahoe around 3:30 on Saturday. I made it there in a pretty fairly straight shot; after stopping for some food along the way, I ended up at the Mellow Mountain hostel at 9:30. The front desk was closing right as I arrived, and I grabbed my room keys and headed over to our room before they headed out for the night. I had called ahead of time and got them to put Charles Steven and I in the same room. I had a bad experience last time with roommates, so it's nice that we were all together. Charles and Steven were a couple of hours behind me, and so I hung out in the common room and hung out with the other folks there. There were a couple of people there that I had met two weekends prior, so it felt warm and invited. We went out to a couple bars, and I headed back to the room to go to sleep around 11:30 when Steven and Charles showed up.  
  
Alarms went off at 6, and we rolled out of bed. I sped over the common room, made some pancakes, and coffee for breakfast. We all clean to sleep from our eyes while waiting for the Sierra avalanche center to release their forecast for the day. The initial plan is to go up Mount talk, but the avalanche forecast showed wet loose Labs on all aspects, pretty heavy wind loading on North to East aspects, and add this in later. We decided to pivot and instead of going talk which was all Northeast gullies, we decided to go to Ralston peak right next to pyramid peak.  
  
Driving West on the 50 out of South lake tahoe, echo peak loomed in the distance and bullied our spirits with its White grandeur. A short drive later found us at the base of Ralston gearing up for a long skin. This was Charles's first time out on backcountry skis. I pray for the day was pretty mellow we would go up to the top of Ralston peak drop over Eastern side down to a lake turn around head back up Ralston peak again visit cup lake on the way down and then ski out to the car.  
  
The day was forecasted to be very hot but starting early in the morning was pretty darn cold. Couple of minutes of skinning fix that problem though. We had parked on the opposite side of route 50 on the end of a dead end road and had to climb the massive snow banks that flanked either side of the highway to get to the bottom of the hill. We made quick work if the first trip to the summit. Steven took the technique of going straight up the hill, and I took wide sweeping arcs. Charles with the difference between the two of us. The bottom section of the approach was up a stream gully, which then rounded out into a long relatively flat traverse up to the top.  
  
We were treated to absolutely impeccable weather it was 45° and sunny the whole day and only a few clouds in the sky to cover up the sun when it seemed to get too hot. When we first reached the rouse and peak, we were treated to views in every direction, from desolation wilderness to lake tahoe, to the mocha lume? To the South east.  
  
Pyramid peak looms close by but still in the distance. The whole time that I was up there today, I was looking at the route that I had planned for my ski traverse, and thinking about how fantastic it would be to be able to make that happen. I think that this coming weekend, if I have any energy left in me, I might try and do a one-way traverse from somewhere north of insert peak here, down to pyramid peak and 50. Steven said that he might be available to drop me at my car if I do it one way traverse. The route looks gorgeous, and the snow and conditions are absolutely perfect to do it now. Travel is fast and the days are long.  
  
We hung out at the summit for a little while looking over my map of the desolation wilderness and trying to identify the peaks around us, before heading down the the Northwest side down to aloha lake. Charles pulled out Steven's drone included along and tried to capture images of Steven and I skiing down. We made quick work down to the lake, where we hung out for a little while. I made some in parentheses oats protein powder and coconut flakes parentheses while Steven and Charles hung out. On the opposite side of the lake, there was a little 3 to 400 ft Rocky outcropping, which we decided to skin over to and make a quick Ascent to the top. Between the blue skies this midday sun and the terrain around us it was a stunning Vista from the top.  
  
With the snow quickly melting in the midday Sun we packed up our things and headed back up to the top of Ralston peak. It was a bit of a slug to get there, and we stopped for a minute on the way up to boil some snow for water, but we made it eventually. The wind hadn't died down much since our first trip to the top, but the sun was out, and the temperatures were a little bit warmer.  
  
Our next objective was to go check out cup league. At one point we had planned to head up to couple and camp for the night, but it wasn't in the cards for this weekend. It was a quick ride down the ridge to the top of the cliff overlooking cup lake, and we quickly decided with the cornices and the snow conditions, that it wasn't worth going down. We added cup lake to the checkout later list. It was now 3 years so and so we decided to head back to the car. We skied down the path that we had skinned up, and with all of the solar radiation from the day the hard pack with a little bit of a dusting from the morning had turned into corn slush. The snow is incredibly sticky, and required skiing with my knees basically in a 90° angle to keep myself from going over the front of them. When we got most of the way to the bottom we decided to stop and skin back up for a section just to hit 5K elevation for the day. Steven and Charles were really feeling it by the time we made the ascent but we hit 5K and felt good about it. Last adventure of the day was skiing out back to the car along the burnt section of the side slope that we had skinned up before.  
  
We made it back to the car and I reveled as I always do in putting on a cotton sweatshirt and dry socks. Charles had brought a giant pack of Costco croissants, and as bad as the croissant was it was one of the better croissants I've had in my life due to the circumstances. By this point it was around 6:00 p.m., so we packed up our things, headed down the hill to Placerville, and capped off the day with a hearty meal at a diner.
