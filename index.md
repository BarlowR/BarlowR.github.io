#### Global Biodiversity Decline



We are living in a time of ecological crisis. Scientists have identified that we are very likely in the 6th mass extinction in the history of earth, signaled by an incredibly rapid rate of species extinction (Barnosky, Anthony D., et al) compared with our fossil records. Not only are we seeing extinctions, we are also seeing massive population and range declines nearly across the board; some have gone as far as to call it a “Biological Annihilation” (Ceballos et al. 2017). 

Biodiversity is at surface level simply variety and variability of life. It is generally viewed at three levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Genetic biodiversity is the amount of gene variation within a given species. A great example of this is dogs, who are members of the Canis lupus species, but whose genetic diversity can be seen in the phenotype diversity of the ~450 different recognized breeds. In fact, dogs are the most variable mammals on earth. Next, species biodiversity is characterized by the number of different species within an ecological community. This could be seen as synonymous with species richness, although species biodiversity measures can include species evenness, which is the relative abundances of species in a community. Figure 1 shows plots of bird, mammal and amphibian richness throughout the world. Finally, ecosystem biodiversity is the variation of ecosystems within a given geographical location.

The current worldwide extinction rate among all species is estimated to be 100 times higher than the historical baseline (Ceballos, Gerardo, et al, 2015). In North America alone, researchers have shown a net loss of 3 billion birds, or 29% of population levels since just 1970 (Rosenberg, Kenneth V., et al. 2019). This is catastrophic. Biodiversity is at the core of our world; all species are part of natural feedback systems within their ecological environments which facilitates the continuing function of that ecosystem. When a major disruption happens, that feedback system may compound the effect. Take for example the sea otter population of our west coast. Sea otters are a predator of sea urchins, and when sea otters were hunted near to extinction for the fur trade in the 1800s, sea urchin populations boomed. The sea urchins then took over the undersea kelp forests, eating so much of them that they nearly disappeared, along with all of the species that depended on the kelp (Estes, James E., et al 1978). Fortunately sea otter populations have since been reintroduced and kelp forests have begun regrowing, but this is just one example of the effect of the near loss of a species. It’s difficult to even imagine the effect of the modern global extinction. 

As one might imagine, humans are the cause of this sixth extinction. Through deforestation, large scale farming operations and urban expansion, we’re slowly destroying natural habitat throughout the world. We’ve also been prolific in introducing species into ecosystems where they would have never normally existed, causing havoc. Even just our mammalian house pets, dogs and cats, are among the largest contributing factors in the extinction of 140 different species and the endangerment of ~600 others (Pandolfi et al. 2003). There is also the issue of pollution, which chokes the air with smog, fills streams and rivers with toxic chemicals and farm runoff, and covers the earth and the ocean with trash. Then there’s the issue of overharvesting, wherein we’ve simply killed off entire populations of species, be it cod, bluefin tuna or the aforementioned sea otters. 

As if those reasons weren't enough on their own, climate change is one of the greatest factors causing the decline of biodiversity that we are seeing. In a European study, it has been shown that global temperature increases directly correlate to higher species turnover and lower species area. Specifically, in the year 2100, Northern Europe is predicted to be nearly 35% new species composition and Southern Europe will see a disappearance of 25% of the 2010 levels of species (Alkemade et al. 2011).
