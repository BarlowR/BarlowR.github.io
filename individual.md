#### Individual Action

Given this incredible problem, what can be done? It is easy to minimize ones perception of their own effect, especially at such a global scale, but individuals can have a large impact. The first step anyone can do is simply help to spread awareness of this impending crisis; it doesn't seem like this issue has achieved the level of global attention that it deserves. Speak with your friends and family regarding biodiversity loss, and urge them to do the same.



Another incredibly important point of action is exercising your democratic right to vote. Many of the structural changes that need to take place are only possible at a legislative level. For more information on policy level changes to reduce biodiversity level loss, see the 4th section of <a href = "https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/151469"> this report,</a> put together by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. 



There are other proactive steps that one can take. Here are a couple examples:

* To combat deforestation, one could reduce their use of single-use products, and look for 100% post-consumer recycled content materials in products. 
* Keep tabs on your pets. Cats have been estimated to kill tens of millions of birds each year in North America. (Dauphin√© et al. 2009)
* Pollution is another area of opportunity; help out at your local green up day, and reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in your lawn care. Composting both reduces the waste in landfills and provides fantastic fertilizer. 

The most effective way that an individual can slow the loss of biodiversity is through measures to reduce climate change. However, there are many misconceptions regarding "green" actions, primarily propagated by companies looking to use conservation and climate action as marketing points. To avoid these traps, one should be skeptical about the actions they chose to take and the products they buy; for example, will a reusable straw have any real impact on global plastic waste, or it is simply an act of performing greenness?

Fortunately, a paper has been published that qualifies individual actions on climate change. Figure 1 shows the results from this paper, with actions grouped by high, moderate and low impact. Note that the scale is broken by the item, "Have one fewer child," which has a yearly emissions savings of 120 tonnes of CO2 per year for those of us in the USA. This is **40x** greater than the second greatest item, "Live car free." Note that this is yearly; having one fewer child is possibly the greatest individual impact that any single person can have when this savings is aggregated over the lifespan of a human. 

For those of us who aren't considering children, this paper highlights the next best actions that we can all take. Actions related to car efficiency and/or living car free are highly impactful, as is avoiding very long flights. A plant based diet is another great opportunity, and as long as one avoids soy products, this also helps fight deforestation (Nepstad et al. 2014).
