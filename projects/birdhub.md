## BirdHub

​​​​​​​The Bird Hub is a IoT connected solar-powered bird feeder. The feeder takes pictures of birds when they come to feed, and records ambient envornmental data. This project was a product of Principles of Engineering, a project-based class at Olin College of Engineering. The overall objective of The Bird Hub is to provide birds with food, regulated shelter, and predatory defense through a standalone, sustainably-powered bird feeder that updates human users on environmental conditions, bird visits, and system efficiency. 
On our team of 5, I designed and fabricated the bird feeder and feed dispenser, designed and implemented the electrical system for image capture, data measurement, processing, data transmission and battery charging. I also wrote the code for all elements of the project, and assisted with the construction of the solar panel.
