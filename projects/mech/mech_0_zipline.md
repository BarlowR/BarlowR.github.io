From July 2019 to July 2020, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at Zipline International in South San Francisco. I began the internship with ~2 months on the ME team, where I worked through the development of mechanical testing equipment for Zipline's snap-catch system and an updated package loading stand for the latest generation of Zipline's aircraft. After completion of those projects, I shifted to Zipline's perception team for the rest of the internship. 

On the perception team, I worked with one other mechanical engineer in a small, multidisciplinary group to develop Zipline's perception system. We began with one-off prototype systems, where I was designing quick turn machined plastic parts and modifying Zipline's production wings to accept our perception system. Over the course of my internship, we scaled the system to volume production. I supported development of the system at each step along the way:

- Designed parts for manufacturability, and adapted our machined plastic components for volume injection molding
- Sourced vendors to complete work that we couldn't do in-house, and worked with those vendors to ensure that they were hitting our quality standards
- Stepped in to work as a manufacturing technician to take out the slack in our schedule, shortening the team's build timeline by months.
- Worked closely with an electrical engineer on the team to develop a compute PCBA and enclosure for the system with stringent thermal, space and weatherproofing requirements. I designed the thermal and weatherproofing solution for the system, which has been implemented in ~40 aircraft with no thermal or water ingress failure to date.
- Retooled a composite wing mold to enable integration with the perception system
- Developed a manufacturing line and training documentation for the compute PCBA solution and trained a manufacturing technician to build the system.



This was my main work, but at any given point I always had at least 2 side projects going on. Here's a list of some of the cooler ones: 

- Worked to maintain Zipline's machine shop and setup a 2D CAM import workflow on the Mill  
- Purchased & personally refurbished a South Bend 14" lathe to expand machine shop capabilities
- Along with another ME on the perception team, I built a remote control version of Zipline's production aircraft to enable testing outside of Zipline's nests
- Setup a electrical prototyping bench
- Designed and sourced a sheet metal grounding shield to interface with a key aircraft PCBA to alleviate ESD issues
- Put together a UV irradiation testing chamber and used it to quantify the effects of sun exposure on Zipline's aircraft launcher components
- Flew to Rwanda to support the rollout of a new generation of aircraft at one of Zipline's nests
