In the Spring 2017 session of Olin's Mechanical Prototyping, my team was tasked with telling an aquatically inspired story through a kinetic sculpture powered with a single motor. FLOW was our answer to this challenge. 

</p>
<p>
FLOW simulates the motion of water with 25 aluminum balls, 5 rows of 5, that rise and fall in 3D wave motion. We use two sets of 25 cams to inscribe a sinusoidal wave onto both the x and y axis of the grid, and a 4 bar linkage to raise and lower all of the balls. Each element is driven with a slightly different gear ratio; the result is a 3D wave that repeats itself once about every 1000 cycles. 
</p>
The sculpture is built around a frame of water-jet cut aluminum and is driven from a single 12v motor. We use 3D printed CAMs, a single set of gears, 2 belts, and a mixture of steel and aluminum hardware. For more information about the construction of FLOW, my teammate Ashley Funk put together a great design report, available <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14TrUumX1zIyyX0Sxm6rL3-4ZSjkp3Ins/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

On the project, I took lead on ideation, conceptual design, and CAD, which was done in SolidWorks. I also worked with teammates to fabricate the clock cage structure, 3D print the CAMs and assemble the whole system.
