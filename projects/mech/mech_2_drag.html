As a final project for the Spring 2018 course Robotic Systems Integration, I investigated the performance improvement of a quasi-continuous control surface compared to a standard control surface in an undersea application. I believed that a continuous curve, mimicking the tail of a fish, would be more efficient than the standard "plane on a pivot" that boat rudders and underwater unmanned vehicles employ.

To study the differences between the two, I created a testing platform consisting of a styrofoam hull and radio controlled thruster. I then 3d printed three sets of control surfaces. The first was a control, and had no pivot, while the second had a single point of deflection and the third had three points of deflection. I then setup a downward facing camera over our robotic laboratory's pool, and ran a number of tests with constant thrust and varying angles of deflection of each control surface. Finally, I used a motion capture software to quantify the movement of the test platform under each scenario, and computed the coefficient of drag and rotational velocity for each test using the steady state motion. 
</p>

I found that for a given angle of deflection, the drag coefficients did not change significantly between the two control surfaces. However, the "continuous" control surface did have a statistically significantly higher rotational velocity. This difference was even more pronounced in high deflection cases, where I hypothesize that the standard control surface left the laminar flow regime. 

</p>

My research suggests that continuous control surfaces may provide significant improvements over standard control surfaces, especially where high rotational speeds are important. However, I believe that further study is necessary to validate these findings.
