<p>
As a final project for the Spring 2019 Fundamentals of Machine Shop Operation course, I machined a Tesla turbine. Tesla turbines are blade-less centripetal flow turbines that rely on the boundary layer effect to achieve incredibly high rotational speeds; mine spun at 24,000 RPM before the compressed air supply was removed. 
This project took ~75 hours of machining time, and utilized a number of our shop's capabilities: water-jet cutting, 3 axis manual milling/turning to ± 0.0002", and 2.5 axis CNC programming/machining.
