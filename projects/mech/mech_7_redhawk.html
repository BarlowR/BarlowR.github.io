I built the Red Hawk in high school as a personal project. It's a RC sailplane based around the Radian Pro airframe, equipped with a first person view video system, 2 axis head tracking and long range control system. I also included a GPS/barometer-based onscreen display.

Below is a flight over the White Mountains in NH. All units onscreen are empirical (feet/miles), and the reading are accurate. In this flight, the RedHawk flew 2+ miles from the launch point, and nearly a mile up in the air. Please note that this was done before the introduction of FAA part 107, and at the time this was in a legal grey area. With the introductiong of them new sUAS legislation by the FAA, doing this would be very illegal.
