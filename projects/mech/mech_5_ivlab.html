​​​​​​​In the summer of 2017, I worked in Olin's Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory. My main tasking was the "On Demand" contract with SSCI (Scientific Systems Company Inc). The contract was based around the creation of a fixed wing sUAS for "On Demand" fire fighting: the craft needed to be flown at very low altitudes in turbulent conditions, and be quickly deployable from short runways. The aircraft also needed to be able to carry a payload of fire-suppressant, and be able to manually dump this payload "on demand".

To solve this challenge, I created the HammerHead. Based around the Skyhunter airframe, this aircraft is able to fly at speeds up to 60MPH, stay aloft for 30+ minutes and carry/drop 2.5lbs of powdered fire suppressant (half of a standard sized flour bag). It can be launched in 30 feet using a custom catapult, and is agile enough to make sub-5' blanketing passes. Below is a short video of one such blanketing mission, with flour substituted for the fire suppressant powder.
