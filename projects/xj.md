## 2 Door 4x4 Jeep Cherokee 

[I think Jeeps are pretty cool.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNg0o3SXSN4) It's a point that I'm willing to debate, but while living in California I came across a 2 door XJ on Craigslist for a reasonable price, and I foolishly picked it up. This began a 4 month saga of late nights and weekends spent in my tiny garage, stripping the whole thing, cleaning it up, and pulling it all back together. Here's a list of everything that I replaced/fixed/installed:

After owning it and driving it for a while, I came to realize that as cool as it was, I really didn't need it. I was mostly just driving it to work, and when I did do a longer trip into the mountains, I was paying out of the nose to push the square body and 4x4 drivetrain at 80mph down the highway, to get somewhere that I could just as easily get with my front wheel drive 2000 Toyota Rav4. I ended up selling the Jeep and hanging on to the Toyota, and while I still think the Jeep is wicked cool, I don't regret my decision.
