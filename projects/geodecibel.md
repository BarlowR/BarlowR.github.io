## Geodecibel

Music has been a huge part of my life, from playing guitar to listening to my favorite artists. After finally getting around to reading "The Great Sound Stereo Speaker Manual," a gift from a few years back, I decided to dive into speaker design. 

After reading through hundreds of posts at diyaudio.com, I settled on the square truncated rhombic dodecahedron design, championed by [Matthew Kennedy](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8&text=Matthew+Kennedy&search-alias=digital-text&field-author=Matthew+Kennedy&sort=relevancerank) and [Thomas Weiss](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_2?ie=UTF8&text=Thomas+Weiss&search-alias=digital-text&field-author=Thomas+Weiss&sort=relevancerank). They go into great detail on the design in[ this book](https://www.amazon.com/Hypercube-Speakers-Hypersolid-Resonator-Construction-ebook/dp/B076HFVV46/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1513029616&sr=1-1&keywords=hypercube+speakers), and in[ Tom's Blog](http://tomz-randomdistribution.blogspot.com/). While I'm a little skeptical about some of their claims of this configuration, the geodesic shape is gorgeous, and an ample challenge to construct. 

After some deliberation in Fusion 360 CAD and a few test renders in Keyshot, I worked out design I could manufacture with the tools available. I was able to create rhombic sections out of plywood on the ShopBot, which I then glued together at 120[Â°](https://www.degreesymbol.net/) angles with a custom jig. The faceplate was likewise CNC milled to fit a Dayton Audio RS100 4" Woofer and Dayton Audio AMT Mini-8 Air Motion Transformer Tweeter. I designed a 2nd order crossover using VituixCAD, and implemented it using high quality audio capacitors and my own hand-wound inductors. Finally, I created a removable dust-cover from audio fabric and slotted plywood triangles. 

After hearing a demo of the first pair, a friend of mine fell in love with the speakers and commissioned me to create a second pair for him. Iterating on my lessons from the first pair, I redesigned the speakers to be slightly smaller and to utilize a single full range driver each.
