## Baltic Telecaster

I've been playing guitar since high school, and I always dreamed of building my own guitar. During my free time as a instructor for my school's Shopbot and woodshop, I went about pursuing this dream. I cut up a sheet of 7 ply baltic birch plywood into 2x16" strips, and laminated them together end to end. After planing the block down to parallel, I modeled a telecaster body in CAM and routed out the body on the Shopbot. I finished the body with tung oil, and completed the guitar with a pre-made neck and hardware I bought online. I'm not one for owning multiple guitars, so I setup a 7 way rotary switch to step between combinations of a split coil humbucker neck pickup and humbucker bridge pickup. After getting everything together, I did a full setup on the guitar, including leveling the fretboard, filing the nut height, setting the action and neck relief.
