## The Whites

Having grown up in the north east, I've spent a ton of time messing about in the White Mountains of NH/ME. They're a special place, and they continue to challenge me whether I'm hiking, backpacking, skiing or biking. One day I saw a paper 3D relief topo map in an outdoor gear store of the Mt. Washington region, and I couldn't stop thinking about how cool it would be to do the same in wood. After some searching, I found the (USGS' National Map)[https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/national-map], which is a repository of GIS data for the entire united states. One of the datasets they provide is a 1m resolution height map of the entire US, which I was able to wrangle down to within the bounds of the White Mountain National Forest. From this 3D model, I created a CAM program to run on the ShopBot, and I machined the map out of a ~18" by 10" scrap from an old cutting board.
