TAE Furniture is a foldable furniture company I started in the spring of 2017 with a group of fellow students. We set out to create a product for college students that is cheap, comfortable, and takes up little space in cramped dorm rooms. 

Our main product was the "OIE" chair, pictured above. It's CNC cut plywood, finished and sealed with an oil based stain and strung up with para-cord. The chair folds up to a 1 inch thick rectangle 2' by 4'.
