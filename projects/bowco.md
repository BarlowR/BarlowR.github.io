From 2017-2019, I was the president of the Babson-Olin-Wellesley climbing organization. Between the 3 colleges, we had ~150 members, and a $8000 yearly budget. Throughout the course of the year, we ran "taster" events to introduce new students to climbing, day and weekend long outdoor climbing trips to destinations, competition trips, and 4x per week carpools to the local climbing gym. I lead our cross-college leadership team in organizing these events, fund-raising, logistics, and the facilitation of a climbing scholarship fund to ensure that there were no financial barriers for students to go climbing. In my second year as president, we formed a competition team to compete in the Boston collegiate climbing circuit.
