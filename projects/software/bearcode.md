Over the winter of 2017-2018, I worked as a contractor for Bear Code LLC, a small custom software development company based in Montpelier, VT. In my time at Bear Code, I developed an integration testing framework for their Aprexis Health project. The project was based on Ruby on Rails, so I was able to leverage Minitest and Capybara to setup a framework for writing simple, readable end-to-end tests for the application.
