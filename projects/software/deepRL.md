# Deep Reinforcement Learning

As a final project for Olin's Computational Robotics course, a fellow student and I took a dive into reinforcement learning. We started with implementations of Q-learning agents as described by Richard Sutton in his textbook on reinforcement learning. After familiarizing ourselves with the ideas, we then split off down two separate paths of deep reinforcement learning. My partner worked towards an implementation of Deep Q learning, while I chose to work with policy gradient methods. Our website on the project can be found here:

I've since forked the project to continue to play around with policy gradients, with the eventual goal of training a policy gradient network to perform as well as Deepmind's DQN implementation from 2013. I've made a bit of headway, including the creation of a cpu worker pool to simultaneously train multiple OpenAI gym environments at once, but my life got busy and I haven't had much time to continue to work with this.
