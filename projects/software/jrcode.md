From my spring semester in 2017 through the end of the spring semester in 2018, I worked as an Instructor for JrCode in Wellesley.  JrCode was a small afterschool program started by two Wellesley parents to introduce students to programming in the Scratch and Python languages. The program has since dissolved; I think the parents' children grew up. I taught 3 courses: 2 courses with the Scratch platform, based around introducing younger students to the basics of coding, and one course in Python on more advanced concepts for older students. The Python course culminated in the students creating their own short video game with the PyGame module.
