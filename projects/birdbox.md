## Birdbox

While browsing through Olin's library one day, I stumbled on the book *How to Build Your Own Living Structures*, by Ken Isaacs. In the book, Isaacs details a number of plans for how to build sustainable, eco-friendly, modular living structures that are larger than furniture but smaller than traditional furniture. I was particularly enamored with his [microhouses](https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.metropolismag.com/content/uploads/2020/02/Isaacs2.jpg): 24 sided, human scale living structures that could easily be constructed from plywood with simple tools. 

Despite a petition to Olin's administration, I couldn't get approval to build one of these structures on Olin's campus. As a conciliatory project, I decided to build a birdhouse as an homage to the design. 

The BirdBox is a chickadee home I fabricated from reclaimed pallet wood. I designed the structure in CAD, and then used a Shopbot router to get the right 2d geometry for the panels. I then made a jig to cut the panels to the correct connection angle on a tablesaw, and finally glued up the panels into quadrants and then glued the quadrants together. The BirdBox now lives in Wellesley College's H. H. Hunnewell Arboretum.
