## Birdbox

The BirdBox is a chickadee home, designed by me and fabricated from reclaimed pallet wood. 

Leveraging a Shopbot 3-Axis CNC router and Olin's new advanced woodshop, I set out to create a bio-mimicing departure from standard birdhouse construction. The result is a trapazoidal icositetrahedron, an egg-like 3D polyhedra inspired by Ken Isaac's microhouse. 

The BirdBox now lives in Wellesley College's H. H. Hunnewell Arboretum, where it awaits a nest and family.
